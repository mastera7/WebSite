<h3>Personal Essay</h3>
  <div><p>Ever since my elementary school years, I have been fortunate enough to be surrounded by
curious people who always took time to question things and learn more about them. This unique
aspect of my life has allowed me to explore the world around me and I became bedazzled by
physics.
Luckily, it all came natural to me and I savored each moment of my scientific journey. I was
fascinated by the fact that all natural phenomena could be expressed in numbers, and I found out
that mathematics is the language of the universe. Thus, I was determined to become fluent in
mathematical language and understand nature in all its grandeur and beauty.
Astronomy has a special place in my heart. I remember I used to memorize different trivia and
numerical facts about planets, stars, and nebulas.
Even though science hasnâ€™t been a particularly easy subject to master in the beginning, it has
helped me to understand human life more clearly. Having said that, most likely it will forever be
a never-ending mystery and mind blowing adventure for me.
My passion has helped me to become an international mathematics Olympiad student.
<strong>My ultimate goal is to use my acquired skills to dive more into science and IT.</strong></p></div>
